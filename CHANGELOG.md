# Changelog

Versions are in `VERSION` (data, schema, tool surface) and `package.json`.
Entries below start at the first public audit; earlier history is in git.

## Unreleased

Data 703.

**Source catalogs removed from `docs/`.** `docs/catalogs/` held two
manifests — `source-catalog.json` (137 entries) and
`source-corpus-catalog.json` (71 entries) — plus their two readmes. They
listed third-party C64 sources, per-author repository inventories, and
in-repo path fingerprints (`pattern_signals`) for code this project never
ingested, and the readmes cross-referenced unrelated projects of the
author's. None of it fed the knowledge base: the ingest reads `*.md` only,
so the two JSON manifests were never indexed at all, and the two readmes
carried no frontmatter and no metadata lines, so they extracted zero graph
entities. The measured impact is 18 Qdrant chunks and the `catalogs` bucket
in `c64-kb health`, whose entry in `C64_BUCKETS` (`src/services/qdrant.ts`)
is dropped with them. No graph node, edge, tool, recipe, listing or test
referenced the directory. Doc counts in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` drop
from 75/69 markdown files to 73/67.

**README chunk figure re-measured.** It read 2,422 and was stale: neither
`36d1843` nor the 6510 audit in `5526a80` updated it, and the 6510 page
alone went 258 -> 264 chunks. Running `chunkMarkdown` over all 73 files at
this commit gives 2,516, which is what a clean ingest would upsert. The
table now says it is a chunker measurement, not a live collection reading.

Note: the files remain in git history from `fac663a` onward and in the
public fork. Removing them here removes them from the working tree, not
from the record.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-22

Data 702, schema 18, tools 1.21.1.

**Recipes: assembled, run, rewritten.** None of the eight KickAssembler
recipes had been assembled before this release: six did not assemble, one
ran and did nothing, one was a plain raster IRQ named "stable". All eight
are rewritten, built with KickAssembler 5.25, run headless in VICE x64sc
and measured from the screenshot, with the pictures kept in
`docs/recipes/kickassembler/screenshots/`. Four Oscar64 recipes fixed
(compiler crash on a const function pointer, unreferenced stub array
dropped by the linker, IRQ slot table overflow, GCC attribute syntax).
`npm run check:listings` builds every listing and is part of `npm test`.

**Technique text corrected.** Badline budget is 20 cycles guaranteed
(23 optimistic), not 23 flat. FLI is a forced badline per line with the
$D011 write on cycle 15. The side border is one write cycle (56) with no
left-border toggle. VSP is a late-$D011 DMA delay, not a CSEL toggle. The
KERNAL dispatcher is at $FF48 (29 cycles); $EA31 is the full service
routine, $EA81 the bare exit. DEN is sampled once per frame on line $30.

**Compatibility checker can say no.** Technique entries carry a
`**Demands:**` line from a fixed vocabulary; `c64_check_compatibility`
derives hard conflicts (cpu_exclusive, cpu_vs_irq, sprite_set,
kernal_banked_out, region_mismatch) with a resolution each, keeps shared
register / KERNAL as soft warnings, and reports per technique what the
graph does not know instead of clearing it. `timing-budget` uses 43 cycles
lost per badline and 36 of IRQ overhead.

**Graph and ingest.** New `Resource` node label and `DEMANDS`, `IN_REGION`,
`OCCUPIES` edges (schema 18). Ingest deletes a file's old chunks before
upserting, `--clean`/`--force` recreate the vector collection, unresolved
references are warned about and counted, and eight that had been dropped
silently are fixed in the docs.

**Hardening.** `npm test` runs against a throwaway graph and collection.
README, ARCHITECTURE and ONTOLOGY rewritten to match the code: 23 tools,
12 resources, 12 node labels, 15 edge types, Node 24, root `.mcp.json`.
Eight npm scripts pointing at files not in this repository removed.
